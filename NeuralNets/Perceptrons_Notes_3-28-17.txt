Perceptrons:

Inputs: Numerical Vectors
Outputs: 1 or 0

Classifiers
Linear Classifier:
Find straight line to separate two groups:
-Able to tell which group a data point is in

-Not all data is linearly separable
    -Perceptrons do poorly on this kind of data

f = w1X + w2Y + w3 (vector)

w3 = Constant coeffficient/offset/bias

Output = threshold- if positive, return 1, if negative return 0

Pseudocode:
Inputs: d features, N targets (class labels), learning rate n
Outputs: a set of learned weights

Initialize each w_j (e.g. to a small random value)

while (termination condition not satisified)
    for i = 1: N
        for j = 0: d
            deltaw = n( t(i) - f(i) )x_j(i)
            w_i = w_j + deltaw
        end
    calculate termination condition
    end
